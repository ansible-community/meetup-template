# Ansible Meetup Template

> Edit this repo as suits your meetup. See the [meetup toolkit](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/meetup/en/latest/)
> for additional resources for meetup organizers.

It turns out that organizing and managing a meetup is much easier when involving
the community.

Ultimately, the attendees know best what they would like to hear about.
We'd like to hear your ideas and opinions on what should be in the next meetup!

# Presentation topics


If you would like to suggest and discuss topics for presentations, please look
through the [issues](https://github.com/ansible-community/your-repo/issues
).
If you'd like to see a presentation about something and it isn't there, feel
free to create a new issue!

# Submitting a talk


If you'd like to present a talk, create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ansible-community/your-meetup/issues/new/choose
).

The discussion regarding dates will take place in the GitHub issue

Otherwise, submissions might be kept for the next meetup.
